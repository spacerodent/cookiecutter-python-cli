## What is this?

A default template for a new CLI project, written in Python, to be used
with the [cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io) utility.
Deals with all the boilerplate involved in the setuptools setup, etc.


## How do I use this?

`$ cookiecutter https://github.com/spacerodent/cookiecutter-python-cli.git`


## How to answer these questions?

When running Cookiecutter, you'll need to provide some values.
Here's what they're for:

* `project_name` -- "My Tool"   (Used for marketing.  Keep it short and capitalize accordingly.)
* `repo_name` -- "my-tool"  (Name of the repo.)
* `script_name` -- "my-tool"  (Binary of the script, i.e. what people will run on the command line.)
* `package_name` -- "my_tool"  (Name of the Python module/package used internally.)
